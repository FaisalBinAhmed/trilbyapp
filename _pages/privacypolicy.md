# Privacy Policy for Trilby

Trilby for Hacker News does not collect any user information. User preference for the app is stored within the device itself and does not leave the device.

Your username and password are tranferred once to the Hacker News server for login. The password is never stored on device. After the first succesful login, the subsequent communications are managed automatically by the device. It does not need to send the password again.

**Please note:** Trilby does not and should not ask for any permissions. The permission requirements on the Play Store are the minimum and automatically generated by my build system: Expo EAS. In reality, it does not need those extra permissions. It only needs internet connection and vibration permission.
